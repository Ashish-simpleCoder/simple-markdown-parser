# Simple Markdown Parser

**Simple Markdown Parser** is a lightweight, high-performance markdown parser that converts markdown content directly into JSX. It is designed for modern React-based applications where performance, predictability, and fine-grained control over rendering are critical.

The parser avoids expensive recursive strategies and instead uses **iterative list processing** with caching to efficiently render ordered and unordered lists—even when deeply nested. It also supports inline HTML within markdown, checklist items, image attributes etc.

## How It works
<img width="500" height="281" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/106eaff2-9ad9-41d4-9e8d-566b39f591c3" />




## Features
- Parse markdown into JSX.
- Parse html present in markdown into jsx.
- Render any amount of `ol` and `ul` list independently or nested inside each other. `No Recursion`. So it is very performant.
- `Caching` feature for caching `ol` and `ul` list output in the `mapCache` too prevent going through re-generation of lists if they are not changed.
- Render `checkbox` in list items.
